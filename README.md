## Description
KeepUp is a full stack social media app. With seamless GitHub login integration through Clerk, users can easily access the platform. KeepUp allows users to post 'notes' ranging from 1 to 240 characters. This flexibility enables users to express themselves concisely while still capturing the essence of their message, fostering a dynamic and engaging environment within the platform.

## Purpose
In creating this application, I learned a lot about different approaches to building full stack applications. Building with T3 was so much fun that I went ahead and did it again. You can find that project and all of it's information [here](https://github.com/knlrvr/ttrpg-char-stats-v2).
